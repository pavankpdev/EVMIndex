# Handlers
Handlers are straightforward functions utilized to execute custom logic on indexed data. 
These handlers are triggered either when the indexer captures live data or when processing past logs, depending on the configuration. 

The EVMIndex provides a context object that contains the indexed data and is passed to the handler function. To access and utilize the context effectively, 
you can refer to the following example, which demonstrates how to access the context and assign appropriate types to it.

While it is possible to create handlers anywhere within the project, it is advisable to adhere to the `handlers/<Contract>/<filename.ts>` pattern. 
Furthermore, it is crucial to note that the **handler functions must have named exports rather than default exports**. Finally, these handler functions should be added to the `config.yaml` file for proper integration and execution.

### Example

In this example, we are creating handlers for the `Transfer` and `Approval` events and writing a custom logic to store the data in the database using the mongoDB models generated by the EVMIndex.
```typescript
import {Approval, Transfer} from "@/types/generated";
import {TransferModel} from "@/db/models/Transfer";
import {ApprovalModel} from "@/db/models/Approval";

export const handleTransfer = async (context: Transfer) => {
    console.log(context)
    return TransferModel.create(context);
}

export const handleApproval = async (context: Approval) => {
    console.log(context)
    return ApprovalModel.create(context);
}
```

Notice how the functions have names exports such as `export const` instead of `export default`, this is known as named export. 

### Configuration
